# Tabster

Simple utility for guitar players to organize their favourites tabulatures. <br>

You can add to your collection:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Ultimate Guitar</b> Tabs just by inserting their links. 
Tabster automatically performs scraping of the webpage to get informations such as Title, Artist, Tuning and Capo.
</li>
<li>
Files in the following formats: <i>Pdf, Txt, Jpg</i>. Filename will be overwritten in a significative name given by tab informations.
</li>
</ul>


<b>DISCLAIMER</b>: Originally this wasn't intended for sharing, so the repository isn't clean. <br>
In <i>config.py</i> you have to substitute <b>UPLOAD_FOLDER</b> value to the desired folder where you want to upload and mantain files.
<br>At the moment it's still intended for personal use. So, you should upload the code to a server of yours and reach it. 
It has not support for multi user.
